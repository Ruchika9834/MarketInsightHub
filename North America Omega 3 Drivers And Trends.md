<p><h2>North America Omega 3 Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The North America Omega 3 market is primarily driven by the increasing awareness of the health benefits associated with Omega 3 fatty acids. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious, seeking products that support heart health, cognitive function, and reduce inflammation. As a result, the demand for Omega 3 supplements, fortified foods, and beverages is expanding rapidly. The rise in chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues, further fuels the market, as Omega 3 is recognized for its potential therapeutic effects in managing these conditions.</p><p>In addition, the growing trend toward plant-based diets is a significant factor propelling the demand for plant-based Omega 3 sources.
